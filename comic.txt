Son, have I ever told
you the story of "The 
Boy Who Cried Wolf"?

Once upon a time, there
was this boy who cried
"WOLF" a million times. 
And there were a ton 
of wolf attacks. He was 
viewed as a prophet.

He yelled "WOLF!" so 
much that he lost his 
voice. Without his
yelling, the town was 
doomed to endless
wolf attacks. The end

The moral is that
lying is awesome.
